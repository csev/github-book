<h1>Outer Product</h1>

<p>In linear algebra, the outer product typically refers to the tensor product of two vectors. The result of applying the outer product to a pair of vectors is a matrix. The name contrasts with the inner product, which takes as input a pair of vectors and produces a scalar.</p>

<p>The outer product of vectors can be also regarded as a special case of the Kronecker product of matrices.</p>

<p>Some authors use the expression "outer product of tensors" as a synonym of "tensor product". The outer product is also a higher-order function in some computer programming languages such as APL and Mathematica.</p>

<h2>Definition (vectors and tensors)</h2>

<h3>Vector multiplication</h3>
<p>Given the vectors</p>

<p>u = (u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, ..., u<sub>m</sub>)</p>
<p>v = (v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>)</p>

<p>their outer product <strong>u ⊗ v</strong> is defined as the <em>m × n</em> matrix <strong>A</strong> obtained by multiplying each element of <strong>u</strong> by each element of <strong>v</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>For complex vectors, the complex conjugate of <strong>v</strong> (denoted <strong>v*</strong> or <strong>v̅</strong>). Namely, matrix  is obtained by multiplying each element of <strong>u</strong> by the complex conjugate of each element of <strong>v</strong>.</p>
